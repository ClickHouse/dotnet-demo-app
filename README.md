# ClickHouse.Client .NET Example App

A C# demo app for using [ClickHouse.Client](https://github.com/DarkWanderer/ClickHouse.Client) in .NET

This app is not a production-ready example, just some sample code to show how to run some queries using the Dapper ORM.

The app renders a single HTML page and uses JSON API calls to refresh the data multiple times per second.

The data set used is based on the [Environmental Sensors Data](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/environmental-sensors) example dataset for [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse).
